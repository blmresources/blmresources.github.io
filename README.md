title: Black Lives Matter Resources 
---


This site has been inspired like websites like <https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/> by Nico, and <https://bit.ly/blmcollection> by twitter:@floriidaaaa. 

Creating an opensource website for collecting BLM Resources has many advantages:

* Anyone can contribute;
* The site can be hosted anywhere;
* Anyone can develop this site and add new features if necessary;
* The MIT license allows everyone to share, contribute, download, print this site;
* Anyone can view the source code to audit the code.

The site has been developed using the static site generator, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which means that there is no database, or complicated requirements for developing and hosting this website.  

The following guidelines can help you learn more and contribute:

## Types of contributions we're looking for
There are many ways you can directly contribute to the list of resources. 

* Fix and/or report broken and/or outdated links
* Throughly review and ensure that all links are legitimate resources that are helpful to members of the black community
* Design contributions that make the website more user friendly
* Links to new resources that are helpful to the members of the Black community

## How to contribute

If you'd like to suggest new link to resources, or suggestions, please post them in the [issues](https://github.com/blmresources/blmresources.github.io/issues)

## Setting up your environment
This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Running it on your local machine requires a working [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installation with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Once you have that set up, run:

    script/bootstrap
    script/server

â€¦and open http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.
